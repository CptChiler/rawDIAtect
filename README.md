 # rawDIAtect

This script process the [DIA-NN](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN) output of any DIA LC-MS run analyzed with the [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/) AMR databases and a species background from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) (can be found in ``/Database``). It filter for unique AMR related peptides and only takes a selected amount of them. Furthermore it calculates the TOP-3 precursor quantity and potiental Drug Class spectra. The results are then collected into ``pdf reports``. It can analyze multiple DIA-NN outputs at once and reports every sample individual.  

## Installation

Copy the file ``rawDIAtect.R`` anywhere on your computer an run it with RStudio 
> Run Source or Ctrl+Shift+S
 
 or the inside the bash by 
```
sudo Rscript path/to/your/file/rawDIAtect.R
```
The script will install all dependecies upon the first run.

Dependecies:
 - readr
 - tidyverse
 - profvis
 - tidyr
 - ggplot2
 - dplyr
 - cowplot
 - plyr
 - devtools
 - gameofthrones
 - tm
 - crayon
 - progress
 - Hmisc

## Usage example

### Setup script and options
Before the first run setup up the path to the ``aro_index_DIA.tsv``  at the line **A**. Now the script is ready for your DIA-NN files. 

First change the path and **B** where your DIA-NN output files are stored (*best create a new Folder only containing your files you want to run, on default the ourput will be saved in the input folder*). If you want to save your report elsewhere you can change it at line **C**. You can give your experiment a name at line **F**.

You can change the peptides detection threshold at line **D**. Default is **3** (*best use between 2-4*). If using the Dull CARD the output can be messy, by using the whitelist option at line **E** (1 = one) only whitelisted hits are shown (``KPC,OXA,SHV,TEM,VAN/AB,MCR,CMY,AAC,CTX-M,NDM,VIM``), turn this off if used the Whitelisted CARD.

### Run the script
When everthing is setup you can run the script in RStudio by 
> Run Source or Ctrl+Shift+S

or the inside the bash by 
```
sudo Rscript path/to/your/file/rawDIAtect.R
```
## Output
